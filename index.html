      <p>I started designing and coding a comprehensive professional power tool website in 2011. Using Adobe Photoshop&reg;, a code generator SiteGrinder and Foxy Cart. We called our site “MLMO” – an acronym for Mike Lessick Mica Online which subsequently became a recognized brand. With this website we had no success and very few hits, this might also have been because online stores were viewed with lots of suspicion in South Africa at that time. They were believed to <strong>NOT </strong>be secure.</p>
      <p>Although that 12 month exercise ended up a failure, I joined Mike Lessick Mica Hardware fulltime to start a Key Account Sales Dept and as a Training Manager, October 2012. Later, during my evenings, I re-designed a new <a href="https://www.mlmo.co.za">mlmo.co.za</a> online store using the PrestaShop Framework. I was still not allowed to display prices. I had to be satisfied with my work displayed as a catalog website, the site received hundreds of thousands of hits around 2016-2018. In hindsight this was such a waste…</p>
      <p>The boss's concerns that our prices would be checked and beaten are very real, (our hardware was in the top 4 in Makita power tool sales countrywide), we could not risk this by letting any opposition get ahead through our lack of foresight. Also syncing prices between our online store, (was relatively easy), and the shop floor would have been a nightmare. But an even bigger headache is customers tend to have little respect and no patience for shop sales assistants.</p>
      <p>I am a passionate type of person, some say to my detriment, but despite my artistic tendancies, my boss Dan, schooled me in the art of building up customers from mediocre ones, to become great revenue sources. Regular personal visits also added to that experience which proved invaluable. January 2020, Dan told me to drop the MLMO website, and concentrate on customer visits and  which I duly did…</p>
      <p>COVID-19 put the world into turmoil. Especially for the small and medium businesses who were unfairly locked-down and were clueless about how to survive or rebuild. In South Africa, the Politicians even decided it’s a great time to break the back of so-called white monopoly capital, this is just another concern for those busines owners. (Another night-mare scenario to deal with, Africa seems to have it's share...)</p>
      <p>Dan asked if the website was ready to trade, my jaw drpped open and I quickly reminded him of his January instruction, I heard him mutter, "Then I stuffed-up"! He realised the huge mistake he'd made.</p>
      <p>He hasn't asked me again but after pondering this problem for the last a few weeks, I realised with such great uncertainty in the world, plus I am approaching 63, computer literate and able to hold my own in the graphics arena, I felt compelled to tackle this whole problem again, but by doing it properly time. Become a full-stack web developer</p>
      <p>Once again I started to research and searched for discount coupons to get the best possible deals on courses, from Udemy, and eventually investing in about 8 web development courses. The App Brewery, because I liked Angela's teaching style, Colt Steele because he comes with a big reputation and Brad Traversy who's relaxed manner and highly rated for his individual deep dives. I realise I am commiting myself to a another year or so of really hard work, but as I am a work-a-horlick and a study junkie, I am looking forward to the challenge</p>
      <p>I believe that I will never retire, so it's time to start preparing myself for a less stressful and more fullfilling last 20 years, if I am lucky enough to survive and be granted that time and privilage.<em> So let the games begin...</em></p>
